# Shade Snail

Inspired by Aspidnest and the Immortal Snail, this mod creates an immortal copy of the Shade that follows the player and
tries to hurt them.

The Shade Snail, as I call it, ignores Void Heart, 
can be damaged but not destroyed,
and always tries to follow the player.
If the player manages to get far enough away, it will respawn nearby.
